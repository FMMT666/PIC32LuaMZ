==========

Lua for PIC32MZ Processors.

After all that experiences and fun with Lua on PIC32(MX) MCUs
(see [github.com/FMMT666/PIC32Lua][2]), we're back with a 200MHz, 512bK RAM edition:

Lua for the [PIC32MZ][3] \o/

Upcoming attraction, nothing to see here (for now ;-).

## NEXT STEPS

  - serial interface (USB, VCP)
  - serial interface (RS-232)
  - ports
  - all the other stuff from [here][2]

Have fun
